This is a web application that allows the user to experiment with FM synthesis.

The application uses Web Audio API to generate waveforms in octave of middle C.  The user may select from several waveform shapes.

JQuery is used to manipulate the frequency of the waveforms generated by Web Audio, to draw a keyboard for the user to interact with, and 
to handle user interaction with the keyboard.

Some useful references for following up on FM synthesis:
